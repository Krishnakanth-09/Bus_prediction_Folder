# Bus Prediction System 🚌

## Project Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to predict bus allocation for colleges based on historical transportation data.

## Problem Statement
Manual bus assignment is time-consuming and error-prone. This system automates bus allocation using ML.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Workflow
1. Data preprocessing
2. Feature encoding
3. Model training
4. Prediction

## Sample Output
The model predicts the appropriate bus based on input features such as distance, shift, and capacity.
