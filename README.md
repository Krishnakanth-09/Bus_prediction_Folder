Project Overview :

This project focuses on building an end-to-end Machine Learning solution to automate bus assignment for colleges within a city using structured institutional data. The objective is to reduce manual effort in transport planning and improve operational efficiency by predicting the appropriate bus based on key features.

Problem Statement :

Manual allocation of buses for educational institutions can be:
Time Consuming
Error Prone
Difficult to scale with increasing colleges
This project addresses the problem by using a classification-based ML approach to predict the assigned bus using historical data.

Dataset Description :

The dataset consists of multiple colleges from the same city with the following attributes:

1. Institution type
2. College name
3. Distance
4. Bus route
5. Shift (Morning / Evening)
6. Bus capacity
   
**Target Variable:**  
- Bus Name (represents the assigned bus)

Model Output :

The trained model predicts the bus assignment for a given college based on input features such as route, distance, shift, and capacity.
